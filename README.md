## PoreSpy Backend

Backend written in Django/Python for PoreSpy.

TODO:

- Research how to section off models/serializers in django/python so they are not all concentrated in one file (Separation of Concerns).
- Continue writing out PoreSpy's modules:
    - generators (Currently Blobs is being completed, will branch out to BundleOfTubes and other modules as well)
    - filters
    - metrics
    - simulations
    - networks
    - visualization
    - io
    - tools
